# Azure DP-100 Project Repository Overview

This repository presents the full implementation and automation of a predictive machine learning solution developed on Microsoft Azure Machine Learning. It demonstrates core competencies required for the **DP-100: Designing and Implementing a Data Science Solution on Azure** certification.

## üîó Main Project
- **[Azure DP-100 - Ice Cream Sales Forecasting](https://github.com/AndreLuiz-Cardoso/Data-Science/tree/main/Azure/Azure%20DP-100/Project-1)**  
  A complete end-to-end project using Azure ML Studio and AutoML to predict ice cream sales based on temperature. It includes both a manual pipeline and an automated model selection and evaluation process.
